Need to think about how CSS will work for the parent theme. We won't be able to leverage mixins from the parent theme in the child theme due to how SCSS works. Perhaps the child theme should actually copy the scss directory from the parent and just use it there? Doing that avoids the odd @import that is the standard way that child themes work. This also makes sense from the POV of not sharing a common look and feel between parent and child themes. It's more for sharing functionality and having a good foundation to build on.
